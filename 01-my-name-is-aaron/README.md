# My Name is Aaron

This is an initial rom just to make sure I have everything in place.

The original idea was a simple "Hello world", but I added a few extra things like centering the text and having some randomness and some beeping sound.

This was based on the minimal template project from GBDK-2020.

## Game

It's not even a game. When it loads it will show "My name's" followed by a random name.

This includes:
- Some device constants to align text in the center of the screen.
- Some randomness to display different names randomly.
- String manipulation.
- An infinite game loop with a delay.
- Synchronizing drawings with VBlank interruption.
- Some sound.


Load it, and check it. You should see the text changing every 1s with a beeping sound.
