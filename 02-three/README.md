# Three

A tic-tac-toe inspired variant. Originally based on three men's morris.

## Game

The game starts with each player having three pieces. First player is chosen with the flip of a coin.

The first player puts their first piece anywhere except the center of the board.

Then, per turns, each player puts one of their remaining pieces anywhere in the board (including the center now).

Continuing by turns, each player moves one of their pieces to any free adjacent position.

First who gets three in a row (horizontal, vertical or diagonal) wins.
